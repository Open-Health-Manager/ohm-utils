# Ohm::Utils

Utilities for MITRE's Open Health Managerâ„¢, including
- generate a transaction bundle (create all) from a directory of files with json FHIR resources
- generate a [Patient Data Receipt](https://open-health-manager.github.io/patient-data-receipt-ig/) from a directory of files with json FHIR resources

## Usage

Run using the interactive ruby prompt: `irb -r ./lib/ohm/utils.rb`

### Prerequisites

To use these bundle generation utilities, you must
- have a collection of FHIR resources, one per file
- all stored in the same directory

### Transaction Bundle

To create a transaction bundle (create each entry new) from a directory, use the following command:
```sh
puts Ohm::Utils::createTransactionFromDirectory("[target directory]")
```

This will output the filename where the resulting bundle will be stored, which will be 
- in the parent directory of the target
- with name "[target directory short name]_transactionBundle.json"

### Patient Data Receipt Message Bundle

To create a Patient Data Receipt message bundle from a directory, use the following command:
```sh
puts Ohm::Utils::createPDRFromDirectory("[target directory]", "[username]", "[sourceURL]")
```

This will output the filename where the resulting bundle will be stored, which will be 
- in the parent directory of the target
- with name "[target directory short name]_PDRMessageBundle.json"

## Example

This repository has some sample resource files that you can use to generate example bundles. To generate files resources_PDRMessageBundle.json and resources_transactionBundle.json, use the following commands
```sh
cd /path/to/ohm-utils
irb -r ./lib/ohm/utils.rb
```

Within the ruby interpreter, execute
```rb
puts Ohm::Utils::createPDRFromDirectory("example/resources", "a
394Kutch271", "http://example.org")
puts Ohm::Utils::createTransactionFromDirectory("example/resour
ces")
```
